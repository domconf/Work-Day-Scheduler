# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple task manager that allows you to input your daily tasks into a log. It consists of work day hours so you will find that you can assign tasks to any time slot between 9am and 5pm. After typing in a time slot and saving the task, you are able to leave the page and come back later to see that your daily tasks are still logged. As you can see, the time slots vary between gray; which is the past, red; which is the current hour, and green; which is the future.

## Usage

The Work Day Scheduler is extremely easy to use. Simply click the time slot that you would like to add a task to, type in your task and click the save icon on the right side of the time slot. You will now see that the task has been saved even when attempting to refresh the page. If you would like to update a task that you already logged, click the time slot, type the new task and click save and you will see that upon refresh the task has been updated. If you would like to simply remove a task, just repeat the prior step and dont type anything in! Once you click save, the task will be gone and the time slot will become empty.
